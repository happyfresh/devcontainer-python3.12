# Frontend

This directory is reserved for the frontend application.

## Planned Structure

The frontend will be implemented as a modern React application with:
- Vite for development and build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- File upload interface connecting to the FastAPI backend

## Integration

- Development: `http://localhost:8000`
- Production: Configure via environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Set up Vite React application
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Install shadcn/ui components
4. Implement file upload interface
5. Add routing and navigation
